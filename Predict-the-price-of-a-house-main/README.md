# Predict-the-price-of-a-house
Predicting house prices can help to determine the selling price of a house of a particular region and 
can help people to find the right time to buy a home.
In this repository, I will introduce you to a machine learning project on house price prediction with Python.


 The goal is to understand the relationship between house features and how these
variables affect the house price.
Using more than one model, predict the price of the house using the given dataset. Please compare the
accuracy of the models along with the drawbacks of each technique's assumptions before recommending
the final prediction model.
