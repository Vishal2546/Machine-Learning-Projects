# Product-matching

Product matching is the process of matching identical products from various sources through machine learning technologies. In a competitive landscape, where the customerâ€™s spending habit has altered considerably, retailers are forced to develop a deeper understanding of their products, prices, attributes and more.


Using ML/DL techniques, match similar products from the Flipkart dataset with the Amazon dataset. Once
similar products are matched, display the retail price from FK and AMZ side by side. Please explore as
